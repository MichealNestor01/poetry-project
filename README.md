Simple react project that I made with my friend Kat.

Hosted here until May 2024: https://alteraltar.co.uk

Description of the project from Kat:

Alter Altar is an elegy in found poetry, where I have sourced material from the internet to create an electronic altar for my friend. The memorial messages are infinite and go on, randomly generated by material based on her memorial messages found on facebook and other social media websites. The language used is not new or shocking, but by pulling it out of its original context, we can see what is really in the DNA of the language of mourning. While creating this website I have asked myself questions such as: How do people mourn on the internet? Why has facebook become the modern day altar? My conclusion is that the internet and death are similar in regards to both being geographically incomprehensible and ambiguous, and as a result abstract in its very nature. Perhaps that is why we mourn on the internet because it inhabits the same sort of unknowable space, so it is easier to imagine that maybe the messages we leave online are more accessible to her, wherever she might be now.
